HaiiroNeko
==========

HaiiroNeko is a very incomplete data gathering experiment about Bitcoin.

Right now it only gathers Bitcoin Price informations of 5 Bitcoin
Exchanges and displays the Prices of the last hour, but I want to extend this
project to calculate and display a lot more Data.

Requirements & Installation
---------------------------

If you just want to start the Project in a VM localy install Vagrant and
VirtualBox, start the VM with `vagrant up`, and open [this url](http://192.168.33.10) in a Browser.

To install it on a server you just have to clone the project into `/www`
on the server, install Puppet and run `sudo ./apply.sh` from `/www`.
